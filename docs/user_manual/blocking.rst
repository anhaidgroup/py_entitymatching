Specifying Blockers and Performing Blocking
===========================================

In this section, we discuss how you can specify blockers and perform blocking.

Types of Blockers and Blocker Hierarchy
---------------------------------------

Once the tables are loaded and downsampled, most often you have to do blocking.
Note that by *blocking* we mean to block a *tuple pair* from going through to the
matching step. When applied to a tuple pair, a blocker returns *True* if the pair
should be blocked. You must know conceptually the types of blockers and
the blocker hierarchy in *py_entitymatching* to extend or modify them based on your need.


There are two types of blockers: (1) tuple-level, and (2) global. A tuple-level blocker
can examine a tuple pair in isolation and decide if it should be admitted to the next
stage. For example, an attribute equivalence blocker is a tuple-level blocker. A global
blocker cannot make this decision in isolation. It would need to examine a set of other
pairs as well. For example, a sorted neighborhood blocker applied over an union of the
input tables is a global blocker. Currently, *py_entitymatching* supports only
tuple-level blockers.

The blockers can be combined in complex ways, such as

* apply blocker *b1* to the two tables
* apply blocker *b2* to the two tables
* apply blocker *b3* to the output of *b1*

Further, you may just want to apply a blocker to just a pair of tuples, to see how
the blocker works.

In *py_entitymatching*, there is a Blocker class from which a set of concrete blockers
are inherited. These concrete blockers implement the following methods:

* block_tables (apply to input tables A and B)
* block_candset (apply to an output from another blocker (e.g. table C))
* block_tuples (apply to a tuple pair to check if it will survive blocking)

In *py_entitymatching*, there are four concrete blockers implemented: (1) attribute
equivalence blocker, (2) overlap blocker, (3) rule-based blocker, and (4) black box
blocker. All the functions implemented in the concrete blockers are metadata aware.

The class diagram of Blocker and the concrete blockers inherited from it is shown below:

Built-In Blockers
-----------------
Built-in blockers are those that have been built into *py_entitymatching* and you can just
simply call them. *py_entitymatching* currently offers three built-in blockers.

**Attribute Equivalence Blocker**

Given two tables A and B, conceptually, `block_tables` in attribute equivalence blocker
takes an attribute `x` of table A, an attribute `y` of table B, and returns True (that
is, drop the tuple pair) if `x` and `y` are not of the same value.

An example of using the above function is shown below:

    >>> import py_entitymatching as em
    >>> A = em.read_csv_metadata('path_to_csv_dir/table_A.csv', key='ID')
    >>> B = em.read_csv_metadata('path_to_csv_dir/table_B.csv', key='ID')
    >>> ab = em.AttrEquivalenceBlocker()
    >>> C = ab.block_tables(A, B, 'zipcode', 'zipcode', l_output_attrs=['name'], r_output_attrs=['name'])

Please look at the API reference of :py:meth:`~py_entitymatching.AttrEquivalenceBlocker.block_tables`
for more details.

The function `block_candset` is similar to `block_tables` except `block_candset` is
applied to the candidate set, i.e. the output from `block_tables`. An example of using
`block_candset` is shown below:

    >>> D = ab.block_candset(C, 'age', 'age')

Please look at the API reference of :py:meth:`~py_entitymatching.AttrEquivalenceBlocker.block_candset`
for more details.

The function `block_tuples` is used to check if a tuple pair would get blocked. An
example of using `block_tuples` is shown below:

    >>> status = ab.block_tuples(A.ix[0], B.ix[0])
    >>> status
        True

Please look at the API reference of :py:meth:`~py_entitymatching.AttrEquivalenceBlocker.block_tuples`
for more details.

**Overlap Blocker**

Given two tables A and B, conceptually, `block_tables` in overlap blocker takes an
attribute `x` of table A, an attribute `y` of table B, and returns True (that is, drop
the tuple pair) if `x` and `y` do not share any token (where the token is a word or
a q-gram).


An example of using `block_tables` is shown below:

    >>> import py_entitymatching as em
    >>> A = em.read_csv_metadata('path_to_csv_dir/table_A.csv', key='ID')
    >>> B = em.read_csv_metadata('path_to_csv_dir/table_B.csv', key='ID')
    >>> ob = em.OverlapBlocker()
    >>> C = ob.block_tables(A, B, 'zipcode', 'zipcode', overlap_size=1, l_output_attrs=['name'], r_output_attrs=['name'] )

Please look at the API reference of :py:meth:`~py_entitymatching.OverlapBlocker.block_tables`
for more details.

The function `block_candset` is similar to `block_tables` except `block_candset` is
applied to the candidate set, i.e. the output from `block_tables`.

An example of using `block_candset` is shown below:

    >>> D = ob.block_candset(C, 'age', 'age')

Please look at the API reference of :py:meth:`~py_entitymatching.OverlapBlocker.block_candset`
for more details.


The function `block_tuples` is used to check if a tuple pair would get blocked. An
example of using `block_tuples` is shown below:

    >>> status = ob.block_tuples(A.ix[0], B.ix[0], 'name', 'name', overlap_size=1)
    >>> status
        True

Please look at the API reference of :py:meth:`~py_entitymatching.OverlapBlocker.block_tuples`
for more details.

**Sorted Neighborhood Blocker**

Given two tables A and B, conceptually, `block_tables` works in the following manner.
First, for table A, `block_tables` creates a blocking attribute for every tuple using the output of `l_block_attr`.
Next, for table B, `block_tables` similarly creates a blocking attribute using the output of `r_block_attr`.
Then, tables A and B are combined and sorted on the blocking attribute.

Finally, a sliding window of size `window_size` is passed through the sorted dataset.
If two tuples are within `window_size` positions of each other in sorted order, and the two tuples come from different tables, then the two tuples are returned in the candidate set.

An example of using `block_tables` is shown below:

    >>> import py_entitymatching as em
    >>> A = em.read_csv_metadata('path_to_csv_dir/table_A.csv', key='ID')
    >>> B = em.read_csv_metadata('path_to_csv_dir/table_B.csv', key='ID')
    >>> sn = em.SortedNeighborhoodBlocker()
    >>> C = sn.block_tables(A, B, l_block_attr='zipcode', r_block_attr='zipcode', l_output_attrs=['name'], r_output_attrs=['name'], window_size=3 )

Please look at the API reference of :py:meth:`~py_entitymatching.SortedNeighborhoodBlocker.block_tables`
for more details.

Unlike the other two blockers, since the sorted neighborhood blocker requires the sorted order of all tuples in the database, `block_candset` and `block_tuples` are not applicable and will raise an assertion if called.

Two things to note.
First, consider the trade-off of possible values to `window_size`.
If the size is too small, actually-matching tuples will not be returned in the candidate set (and thus, missed).
If the window size is very large, the resulting candidate set will also be excessively large, hurting performance.
The exact size needed is unique to each dataset.

Second, if `window_size` is smaller than a range of matching tuples, and actually-matching tuples will be missed, not be returned in the candidate set.
However, if the blocking attribute is not sufficient to make a unique sorted order, than the resulting sorted order is one of a set of potential sorted orders.
If the method of sorting changes, for instance if more cores are used, a different sorted order may be returned.
This sorted order may result in a different candidate set being returned.
To avoid this situation it is recommended to add some uniqueness into the blocking attribute (such as the ID), so that there is only one correct sorted order.
This will help ensure the same set of results are returned from the same inputs.
An example of this is:

    >>> A["birth_year_plus_id"]=A["birth_year"].map(str)+'-'+A["ID"].map(str)
    >>> B["birth_year_plus_id"]=B["birth_year"].map(str)+'-'+A["ID"].map(str)
    >>> C3 = sn.block_tables(A, B, l_block_attr='birth_year_plus_id', r_block_attr='birth_year_plus_id', l_output_attrs=['name', 'birth_year_plus_id', 'birth_year', 'zipcode'], r_output_attrs=['name', 'birth_year_plus_id', 'birth_year', 'zipcode'], l_output_prefix='l_', r_output_prefix='r_', window_size=5)

In this example a new attribute `birth_year_plus_id` is used as the blocking attribute, and will always have the same sorted order.

Blackbox Blockers
-----------------
By `blackbox blockers` we mean that the user supplies a Python function which
encodes blocking for a tuple pair. Specifically, the Python function will take
in two tuples and returns True if the tuple pair needs to be blocked, else
returns False. To use a blackbox blocker, first you must write a
blackbox blocker function.

An example of blackbox blocker function is shown below:
::

    def match_last_name(ltuple, rtuple):
        # assume that there is a 'name' attribute in the input tables
        # and each value in it has two words
        l_last_name = ltuple['name'].split()[1]
        r_last_name = rtuple['name'].split()[1]
        if l_last_name != r_last_name:
            return True
        else:
            return False

Then instantiate a `blackbox blocker` and set the blocking function function as follows:

    >>> import py_entitymatching as em
    >>> bb = em.BlackBoxBlocker()
    >>> bb.set_black_box_function(match_last_name)

Now, you can call `block_tables` on the input tables. Conceptually, `block_tables` would
apply the blackbox blocker function on the Cartesian product of the input tables A and B, and
return a candidate set of tuple pairs.

An example of using `block_tables` is shown below:

    >>> C = bb.block_tables(A, B, l_output_attrs=['name'], r_output_attrs=['name'] )

Please look at the API reference of :py:meth:`~py_entitymatching.BlackBoxBlocker.block_tables`
for more details.

The function `block_candset` is similar to `block_tables` except `block_candset` is
applied to the candidate set, i.e. the output from `block_tables`.

An example of using `block_candset` is shown below:

    >>> D = bb.block_candset(C)

Please look at the API reference of :py:meth:`~py_entitymatching.BlackBoxBlocker.block_candset`
for more details.

Further, `block_tuples` is used to check if a tuple pair would get blocked. An
example of using `block_tuples` is shown below:

    >>> status = bb.block_tuples(A.ix[0], B.ix[0])
    >>> status
        True

Please look at the API reference of :py:meth:`~py_entitymatching.BlackBoxBlocker.block_tuples`
for more details.

Rule-Based Blockers
-------------------
You can write a few domain specific rules (for blocking purposes) using rule-based blocker.
If you want to write rules, then you must start by defining a set of features.
Each `feature` is a function that when applied to a tuple pair will return a
numeric value. We will discuss how to create a set of features in the section
:ref:`label-create-features-blocking`.

Once the features are created, *py_entitymatching* stores this set of features in a
feature table. We refer to this feature table as `block_f`. Then you will be able
to instantiate a rule-based blocker and add rules like this:

    >>> rb = em.RuleBasedBlocker()
    >>> rb.add_rule(rule1, block_f)
    >>> rb.add_rule(rule2, block_f)

In the above, `block_f` is a set of features stored as a Dataframe (see section
:ref:`label-create-features-blocking`).

Each rule is a list of strings. Each string specifies a conjunction of predicates. Each
predicate has three parts: (1) an expression, (2) a comparison operator, and (3) a
value. The expression is evaluated over a tuple pair, producing a numeric value.
Currently, in *py_entitymatching* an expression is limited to contain a single feature
(being applied to a tuple pair). So an example predicate will look like this:
::

    name_name_lev(ltuple, rtuple) > 3

In the above `name_name_lev` is feature. Concretely, this feature computes
Levenshtein distance between the `name` values in the input tuple pair.

As an example, the rules `rule1` and `rule2` can look like this:
::

    rule1 = ['name_name_lev(ltuple, rtuple) > 3', 'age_age_exact_match(ltuple, rtuple) !=0']
    rule2 = ['address_address_lev(ltuple, rtuple) > 6']

In the above, `rule1` contains two predicates and `rule2` contains just a single
predicate. Each rule is a conjunction of predicates. That is, each rule will return True
only if all the predicates return True. The blocker is then a disjunction of rules.
That is, even if one of the rules return True, then the tuple pair will be blocked.


Once the rules are specified, you can call `block_tables` on the input tables.
Conceptually, `block_tables` would
apply the rule-based blocker function on the Cartesian product of the input tables A and B and
return a candidate set of tuple pairs.

An example of using `block_tables` is shown below:

    >>> C = rb.block_tables(A, B, l_output_attrs=['name'], r_output_attrs=['name'] )

Please look at the API reference of :py:meth:`~py_entitymatching.RuleBasedBlocker.block_tables`
for more details.

The function `block_candset` is similar to `block_tables` except `block_candset` is
applied to the candidate set, i.e. the output from `block_tables`.

An example of using `block_candset` is shown below:

    >>> D = rb.block_candset(C)

Please look at the API reference of :py:meth:`~py_entitymatching.RuleBasedBlocker.block_candset`
for more details.

The function `block_tuples` is used to check if a tuple pair would get blocked. An
example of using `block_tuples` is shown below:

    >>> status = rb.block_tuples(A.ix[0], B.ix[0])
    >>> status
        True

Please look at the API reference of :py:meth:`~py_entitymatching.RuleBasedBlocker.block_tuples`
for more details.

Combining Multiple Blockers
---------------------------
If you use multiple blockers, then you have to combine them to get a
consolidated candidate set. There are many different ways to combine the candidate sets
such as doing union, majority vote, weighted vote, etc. Currently, *py_entitymatching*
only supports union-based combining.

In *py_entitymatching*, `combine_blocker_outputs_via_union` is used to do union-based
combining.

An example of using `combine_blocker_outputs_via_union` is shown below:

    >>> import py_entitymatching as em
    >>> ab = em.AttrEquivalenceBlocker()
    >>> C = ab.block_tables(A, B, 'zipcode', 'zipcode')
    >>> ob = em.OverlapBlocker()
    >>> D = ob.block_candset(C, 'address', 'address', overlap_size=1)
    >>> block_f = em.get_features_for_blocking(A, B)
    >>> rb = em.RuleBasedBlocker()
    >>> rule = ['name_name_lev(ltuple, rtuple) > 6']
    >>> rb.add_rule(rule, block_f)
    >>> E = rb.block_tables(A, B)
    >>> F = em.combine_blocker_outputs_via_union([C, E])

Conceptually, the command takes in a list of blocker outputs (i.e. pandas Dataframes) and
produces a consolidated table. The output table contains the union of tuple pair ids and
other attributes from the input list.

Please look at the API reference of :py:meth:`~py_entitymatching.combine_blocker_outputs_via_union`
for more details.
