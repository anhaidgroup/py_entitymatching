for more information.

C Compiler Required
-------------------
Installing Using conda
Before installing this package, you need to make sure that you have a C compiler installed. This is necessary because this package contains Cython files. Go `here <https://sites.google.com/site/anhaidgroup/projects/magellan/issues>`_ for more information about how to check whether you already have a C compiler and how to install a C compiler. After you have confirmed that you have a C compiler installed, you are ready to install py_entitymatching. 

Installing Using pip
--------------------
To install the package using pip, execute the following
command::

    pip install -U numpy scipy py_entitymatching


The above command will install py_entitymatching and all of its dependencies except
XGBoost, pandastable, openrefine, and PyQt5.


* To install PyQt5, follow the instructions at `this page <http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/installation.html>`_.

* To install XGBoost, follow the instructions at `this page <https://XGBoost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html>`_.

* To install pandastable follow the instructions at `this page <https://github.com/dmnfarrell/pandastable>`_.

* To install openrefine follow the instructions at `this page <https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Installation-Instructions>`_.

Installing from Source Distribution
-----------------------------------
Clone the py_entitymatching package from GitHub

    git clone  https://github.com/anhaidgroup/py_entitymatching.git

Then,  execute the following commands from the package root::

    pip install -U numpy scipy
    python setup.py install

which installs py_stringmatching into the default Python directory on your machine. If you do not have installation permission for that directory then you can install the package in your
home directory as follows::

        python setup.py install --user

For more information see this StackOverflow `link <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14179941/how-to-install-python-packages-without-root-privileges>`_.

The above commands will install py_entitymatching and all of its
dependencies, except PyQt5 and XGBoost.


* To install PyQt5, follow the instructions at `this page <http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/installation.html>`_.

* To install XGBoost, follow the instructions at `this page <https://XGBoost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html>`_.

* To install pandastable follow the instructions at `this page <https://github.com/dmnfarrell/pandastable>`_.

* To install openrefine follow the instructions at `this page <https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Installation-Instructions>`_.


.. note::
    Currently, py_entitymatching supports a set of experimental commands that help users
    create an EM workflow. Some of these commands will require installing Dask. To
    install dask refer to this `page <http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/install.html`_.
